    <!-- Section 6: Shutters -->
  <section style="background:#f3f6fb;">
    <h2>Shutters</h2>
    <p>
      Shutters are more than a covering, they are a statement piece that brings timeless elegance 
      and long-lasting function to your windows. With their sturdy build and classic design, 
      shutters not only improve your home’s appearance but also add insulation and value. 
      Many homeowners choose shutters because they deliver both beauty and practicality

  <!-- Section 7: Shutter Types -->
  <section style="background:#fef9e7;">
    <h2>Types of Shutters</h2>
    <p>
      Choosing between wood and composite shutters comes down to your lifestyle, 
      design goals, and the environment of your home. Both types offer durability, 
      but each carries its own unique charm and advantages. 
      Our team will help you select the option that matches your needs best.
    </p>
    <div class="boxes">
      <div class="box">
        <h3>Wood Shutters</h3>
        <p>
          Crafted from high-quality hardwood, wood shutters bring warmth and natural beauty into your home. 
          They can be painted or stained in various finishes to match your interior design. 
          Wood shutters are ideal for living rooms, dining spaces, and areas where you want a touch of tradition 
          and luxury combined.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="box">
        <h3>Composite Shutters</h3>
        <p>
          Composite shutters are built to resist humidity and moisture, making them perfect for kitchens, 
          bathrooms, and other high-traffic areas. They offer the same clean look as wood shutters 
          but are easier to maintain and last longer under tough conditions. 
          If you want style with low upkeep, composite shutters are the right choice.
